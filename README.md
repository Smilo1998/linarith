# Linarith â€“ A Minimal Linear Algebra Library in Modern C++

**Linarith** is a lightweight linear algebra library written from scratch in C++.  
It currently supports core vector operations and is being actively developed as part of a learning journey in numerical software, modern C++ design, and performance-aware programming.
